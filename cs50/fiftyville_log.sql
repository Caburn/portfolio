-- Log of all SQL commands used to solve the problem based on a crime mystery of a stolen duck in the ficitonal Fiftyville


-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.
-- First check the schema of the tables in the database
.schema

-- crime_scene_reports will be useful to check for the crime on Humphrey Street on July 28, 2021
select description FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND street = "Humphrey Street";
-- The first result from the query is relevent to the task:
-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Humphrey Street bakery. Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€“ each of their interview transcripts mentions the bakery.

-- Need to check interviews of the three witnessess at July 28, 2021 with the transcript containing 'bakery'
select name, transcript FROM interviews WHERE year = 2021 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%bakery%";
-- Outputs 4 results:
-- | Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
-- | Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |
-- | Emma    | I'm the bakery owner, and someone came in, suspiciously whispering into a phone for about half an hour. They never bought anything.
-- 4 leads:
--    Car leaving parking lot within 10 minutes after the crime.
--    ATM withdrawel some time before 10:15am on the day on Leggett Street
--    Phone call for <1 minute after 10:15am. planning to take earliest flight out on July 29, 2021.
--        The other person on the phone bought the plane ticket
--    Phone call for ~30 minutes. Time unknown
